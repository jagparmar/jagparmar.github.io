    <section id="about">
  <h1>Nice to meet you! I'm Jag Parmar.</h1>
  <p>
    As a computer engineering student, I am passionate about learning. I've always been curious about machines, 
    systems, and how they work. This curiosity shaped my decision to pursue a degree in engineering.      
    I am interested in being able to apply my education and solve complex problems in the real world.
  
    <br><br>
    I have work experience in finance, where I worked as a teller, and later as an advisor, at TD Canada Trust. 
    I worked at TD while pursuing my education, which required me to develop strong time management skills.
    My work experience allowed me to develop professionalism in client relations, sales and gain 
    knowledge about the financial industry.  
    <br><br>
    I am seeking internship opportunities in finance or engineering where I can apply my technical abilities and 
    engineering mindset to solve complex problems from a first-principles approach. I am eager to learn and add value to the organization.
    
    <br><br>
    Outside of school, I enjoy time with friends and family, reading and I love pushing myself 
    at the gym and on the basketball court. A goal I have for myself is learning to play a musical instrument. 
    Don't hesitate to reach out, you can find me on

          <h2>Filter Design Lab: August 2025</h2>
          <p>In this interesting lab we designed and implemented a low-pass audio filter to meet 
            strict frequency response requirements, passing signals from 
            300 Hz to 5 kHz while attenuating high-frequency noise by at 
            least 40 dB at 22 kHz. Selected and calculated component values 
            using Butterworth filter design equations, then simulated the transfer 
            function in MATLAB to verify performance and account for component 
            tolerances. Built and tested the circuit on a breadboard, validating 
            passband flatness and stopband suppression against design specifications.</p>

          <h2>RISC-V CPU Architecture Implementation: June 2025 – August 2025</h2> 
          <p>Developed a cycle-accurate CPU simulator in C, implementing instruction 
            pipelining and modeling all major CPU stages (fetch, decode, execute, 
            memory, write-back). Designed and integrated a cache subsystem with 
            configurable parameters, replacement policies (e.g., LRU, LFU), and 
            performance tracking. Final project combined pipeline hazard detection, 
            forwarding logic, and cache memory to simulate realistic processor performance
