  <h1>Nice to meet you! I'm Jag Parmar.</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a computer engineering student who loves building, learning, 
    and solving problems that connect technology with the real world.
    <br><br>
    With experience in both engineering and finance, I bring a mix of 
    technical problem-solving abilities and experience in client relations.
    <br><br>
    Right now, I'm exploring how my knowledge in programming, engineering and mathematics can be 
    applied to finance and fintech — areas where precision and innovation matter immensely.
    <br><br>
    Outside of school, I enjoy time with friends and family, read and love pushing myself 
    at the gym and on the basketball court. Don't hesitate to reach out on 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagparmar/" target="_blank" class="btn-link">LinkedIn</a> 
    or <a href="mailto:jsp29@sfu.ca" class="btn-link">email</a>!

          <h2>RISC-V CPU Architecture Implementation: June 2025 – August 2025</h2> 
          <p>Developed a cycle-accurate CPU simulator in C, implementing instruction 
            pipelining and modeling all major CPU stages (fetch, decode, execute, 
            memory, write-back). Designed and integrated a cache subsystem with 
            configurable parameters, replacement policies (e.g., LRU, LFU), and 
            performance tracking. Final project combined pipeline hazard detection, 
            forwarding logic, and cache memory to simulate realistic processor performance 
            and analyze execution efficiency.</p>

          <h2>Filter Design Lab: August 2025</h2>
          <p>In this interesting lab we designed and implemented a low-pass audio filter to meet 
            strict frequency response requirements, passing signals from 
            300 Hz to 5 kHz while attenuating high-frequency noise by at 
            least 40 dB at 22 kHz. Selected and calculated component values 
            using Butterworth filter design equations, then simulated the transfer 
            function in MATLAB to verify performance and account for component 
            tolerances. Built and tested the circuit on a breadboard, validating 
            passband flatness and stopband suppression against design specifications.</p>

          <h2>FireSAR Research Project: February 2025 - April 2025</h2>
          <p>Conducted applied research on wildfire detection using Synthetic Aperture 
            Radar (SAR) and interferometric techniques to evaluate InSAR’s potential 
            for predicting wildfire behavior. Collected and processed Sentinel-1 datasets 
            from ASF Vertex to generate before-, during-, and after-fire interferograms 
            over multiple Canadian wildfire sites. Integrated ESA SNAP for interferogram 
            creation, filtering, geocoding, and export, followed by overlay and analysis 
            in Google Earth alongside Sentinel-2 optical imagery. Characterized wildfire 
            perimeters, burn severity, and potential holdover fire indicators by comparing 
            phase and intensity image signatures against optical data to validate detection 
            accuracy.</p>

            patients by enabling memory recall through shared photos, videos, audio, 
            and stories. Implemented a multi-user, cloud-synced gallery system allowing 
            caregivers, family, and friends to collaboratively upload and manage 
            personalized media collections in real time. Focused on an intuitive, 
            accessible UX/UI optimized for users at varying stages of dementia, with 
            secure data handling and minimal interaction complexity to ensure ease of use.
